# Queue-Tournament

This program brings up a  menu asking the user if they would like to play. The user is then prompted to choose the names of two teams, 
choose how many fighters will be on each team, choose the name and type of fighters, then create a tournament with the two teams. 
They will battle by rolling dice and using special abilities until all the characters from a team are defeated. When one fighter defeats another, 
the winner will regain some strength points then move to the back of the fighting queue. 
The user will then be asked if they would like to view the list of defeated characters, then the user will be asked if they would like to play again or quit.
